# Airway Flight Planning Backend Application

In this application, we want to design a small-scale airway flight planning system. It plans that the aircrafts of airline companies will fly from where to where within certain rules.

* There must be daily at most 3 flights for an airline between 2 destinations.
* The aircraft must be owned by an airline.
* The aircraft must not be on another flight at the same time.
* The aircraft cannot make a new flight before returning to the source airport.
* The source airport and the destination airport should not be the same.

## Description

* GET Airlines Request -> localhost:8080/api/v0/airlines
* GET Airports Request -> localhost:8080/api/v0/airports
* GET Aircrafts Request -> localhost:8080/api/v0/aircrafts
* POST Create Flight Request -> localhost:8080/api/v0/flights

Create Flight Sample POST Request ->

}

Using API For Countries: https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/iso  
Using API For Airports in a Country: https://airlabs.co/api/v9/airports?api_key={apiKey}?country_code={countryISO2}

All countries and all airports in Turkey, Spain, Italy, Poland, Sweden and Swiss have been added to the system.
