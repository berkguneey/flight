# Airway Flight Planning Backend Application

In this application, we want to design a small-scale airway flight planning system. It plans that the aircrafts of airline companies will fly from where to where.

```
scheduler.enabled=true
```

* The application can be run locally or in a docker container, the requirements for each setup are listed below.
* You can execute the program on 8080 port with Docker. Go to the project folder then execute following commands.
